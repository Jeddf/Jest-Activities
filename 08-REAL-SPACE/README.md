# REAL SPACE

Complete the application by using the checkIfInSpace function from utils to have our application check the space name provided by the user and let them know if they are in space. This is critical information to know.

## Instructions

* Import the checkIfInSpace function into App.js
* Add functionality to call the function with a name provided by the user.
* Add functionality to display to the user a message about whether they are not currently in space.
* Discuss with a partner, how you would go about testing these new features in App.js using the techniques we've learnt with jest.
* BONUS: Look at using [lodash.debounce](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash.debounce) to have the space check automatically happen when the user stops typing.
