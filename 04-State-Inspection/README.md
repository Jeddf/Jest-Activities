# State Inspection

Let's make the Space Name state default to an astronaut's name. You'll be doing this by setting initial state on the component, and then adding a test to make sure this is happening.

## Instructions

* Run `yarn` to install dependencies
* Run `yarn start` to see the basic app in action.
* Run `yarn test --verbose` to run tests (you may need to hit `a` to run all tests) (the `--verbose` flag is not required but gives a little more information about which tests were run)
* Update the initial state to have a spaceName with an astronauts name of your choice
* Write a test to inspect the instance.state() to check it has the expected spaceName
