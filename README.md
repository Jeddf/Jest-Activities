# Jest Activities

These activities are for a 3 hour class I put together early in 2018 on my stint as instructor on a 6 month coding bootcamp in my evenings and weekends.

The curriculum was provided for me but used mocha + chai, following covering react, I thought Jest was the better tool for students to be exposed to. 8 activities in total; a little TDD up front and then into snapshots and shallow rendering.

The Unsolved/Solved and README structure was standard for the existing bootcamp curriculum.
