# Test the pass

Our `randomColour` function has been made more useful! Our tests are now broken though. Fix the tests and update to cover the new functionality.

## Instructions

* Run `yarn` to install dependencies
* Run `yarn test --verbose` to run tests (you may need to hit `a` to run all tests) (the `--verbose` flag is not required but gives a little more information about which tests were run)
* Read through src/utils/index.js to see the new functionality that's been added to `randomColour`.
* Fix and Update the testing in utils.jest.js for the new color palette functionality that has been added.

### Files to edit

* src/utils/utils.test.js
